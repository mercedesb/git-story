# Anne Boleyn

Anne Boleyn was Henry's 2nd and most infamous wife. She started as Henry's mistress but was not content to fill that role forever and insisted on getting married (King's mistress was an official role in many royal courts). Henry was enamored by Anne and by the thought of having an heir (read: a boy ðŸ‘€) and so he went to work disolving his marriage to Catherine.

Anne married Henry in a secret ceremony 6 months before Catherine and Henry's marriage was declared null. Anne was crowned Queen only 1 month later (the only of Henry's wives other than Catherine to have a coronation). 

Anne was incredibly unpopular with the people of England and ultimately was undone due to untimely miscarriages (Henry wanted a son more than anything), her outspoken demeanor, and flirtatious behavior. Thomas Cromwell, one of Henry's closest advisors is believed to have architected false stories of adultery and incest which ultimately led to her beheading.

Anne left behind one daughter, Elizabeth, who became Queen Elizabeth I, who went on to become one of England's most beloved and longest reigning monarchs after her older sister Queen Mary I died.
