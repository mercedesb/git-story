# Catherine Howard

Catherine Howard was Henry's 5th wife and also the youngest of his wives at just 17 (Henry was 49 when they got married). She has a reputation for not being exceptionally bright but this may be more due to her age than anything else.

Catherine's downfall was her previous alleged sexual history (before she met Henry) as well as allegations of an ongoing affair with her lover and an alleged precontract (betrothal) to another man which would've made her marriage to Henry null and void. 

Catherine was beheaded less than 2 years after her marriage to Henry. Jane Boleyn (Anne Boleyn's sister-in-law) was executed immediately after Catherine for being the one to arrange Catherine's illicit affairs and keep her secret.
