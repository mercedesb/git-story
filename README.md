## Tell the story you want with Git

This is a demo repo to show how to use a variety of Git commands to cultivate your commits before you push them to your remote repo. You have a lot of control over the narrative arc of your commits this way and can make your commits tell the right story to the developer who comes after you.

The explanation for the commands can be found in [git-commands.md](git-commands.md).
