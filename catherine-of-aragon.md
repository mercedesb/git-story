# Catherine of Aragon

Originally married to Henry's older brother, Arthur, Catherine became Henry's wife (by Henry's choosing) upon his brother's death. Catherine and Henry had a happy and loving marriage for many years (I mean... there were still a lot of mistresses but by the standards of the time they were happy). 

Henry fell in love with Anne Boleyn and insisted that the Catholic church annull his marriage to Queen Catherine b/c incest (long story). Catherine, a devout Catholic, rejected this notion and refused to agree to an annullment or a divorce. This is the whole thing that made Henry create the Church of England (which was basically still Catholic just without the Pope and the Vatican).

Henry and Catherine had 1 surviving daughter, Mary (also a devout Catholic), who would go on to be Queen Mary I, aka Bloody Mary, after her father's and younger brother's deaths (King Edward VI).
