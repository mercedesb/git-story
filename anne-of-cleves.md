# Anne of Cleves

Anne of Cleves was the sister of a Protestant leader in Germany. Henry believed that this political marriage would create a much needed alliance with the Protestants (there was much religious upheaval throughout Europe at this time). 

Henry and Anne were betrothed before the two had met and upon Anne arriving in England, Henry was very vocal about his lack of desire to marry Anne because she wasn't impressed by him enough and he didn't think she was pretty enough ðŸ™„ However, they did move forward with the marriage.

6 months after they married, their wedding was annulled. After the annulment, the two actually became quite good friends. Henry gave her many lands and often invited her to court.
