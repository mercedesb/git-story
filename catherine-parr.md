# Catherine Parr

Henry went from his youngest wife to his oldest for his 6th wife, Catherine Parr. Catherine Parr was twice widowed by the time she came into Henry's life. Catherine was one of his most trusted wives (in my opinion, only second to Catherine of Aragon 'the early years'). He left her as regent when he went to war in France and proclaimed that if he died, she would stay regent until his son Edward was old enough to rule.

Catherine Parr never had children of her own but was extremely sympathetic to Henry's children and advocated for Mary and Elizabeth to be legitimized and added back to the line of succession (Henry had previously illegitimzed Mary when he was married to Anne Boleyn and Elizabeth after Edward was born).

Catherine Parr was Protestant and evoked ire from Henry for her religious leanings. Ultimately, she hid her true religious feelings from him and they reconciled but she died a Protestant with a full Protestant funeral. Catherine outlived Henry by 1 year and 8 months and remarried 6 months after his death.
